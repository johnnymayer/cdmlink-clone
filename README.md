# Site Clone with Angular

This is an Angular site clone of [Create Digital Music](http://cdm.link).  A site I frequently browse that contains posts regarding music, music technology, music hardwares, etc.  This project is an exploration in Angular, and site building.

## Technologies

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
