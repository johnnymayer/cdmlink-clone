# Site Clone with Angular

This is an Angular site clone of [Create Digital Music](http://cdm.link).  A site I frequently browse that contains posts regarding music, music technology, music hardwares, etc.  This project is an exploration in Angular, and site building.

## Technologies/Development

* [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
* VS Code
* Angular
* JavaScript & TypeScript
* Chrome

## Features
  * Blog Posts
    * User can view blog posts.  I was unable to find a database containing blog postings.  I may add a news database in the future, specifically one that includes news stories regarding electronic music, electronic music hardware, etc.
  * User created blog posts
    * Started framing this out.  Struggling with the add option, perhaps a database set up specifically for blogs would be an excellent option.
  * Header
    * The header is virtually the only thing I feel confident with at this time.   It has temporary buttons for category tags.
  * Categories
    * Add categories, so that blog posts can be tagged with specific categories in order to implement a sort by category, or show all blog posts matching those categories.
    
   **NOTES
    I am struggling with front end design.  It is a major challenge for me as I am not interested in it overall.  I do however like the layout aspect and design scheming.  I think that the way I have been learning and implementing coding is certainly in a back end style. I oftentimes get too easily lost in design elements as a perfectionist, which doesn't give me enough time to focus on back end dynamics and code.  I have been particularly struggling with back end standards and coding in Angular.  I feel like there is a lot to learn overall, and even with a lot of extra study time over the week, I feel behind in the overall basic implementation of Angular.  I also end up having to study and reread lots of design material in order to get things to look just right.
