# Site Clone with Angular

This is an Angular site clone of [Create Digital Music](http://cdm.link).  A site I frequently browse that contains posts regarding music, music technology, music hardwares, etc.  This project is an exploration in Angular, and site building.

## Technologies & Development Tools

* [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
* VS Code
* Angular
* JavaScript & TypeScript
* Chrome
* Git version control

## Features
  * Blog Posts
    * User can view blog posts regarding music, music technologies, and music hardwares.  These are accessible via categories, selected "top" stories on the home page.
  * Ad Integration - *Feature Proposal*
    * Deliver ads in order to monetize traffic to the site.  Specific ad categories could include, but are not limited to: music retailers, music hardware retailers, music services, etc.  Most ads would be user targeted with relevant services or retailers to the end user.
  * Database
    * All blog posts will be available in a database.  This will provide offsite storage for blog posts.  *Future features may include API integration of this database in order to serve blog material to other sites.*
  * Categories
    * Add categories, so that blog posts can be tagged with specific categories in order to implement a sort by category, or show all blog posts matching those categories.
